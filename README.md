Q-Fade is deigned to live on master, or bus channels. As Q-Fade has 8 input channels, it is not suitable for use with all DAWs. Q-fade is known to work in with the following software:

-   Reaper (some pre-configured projects are included)
    
-   Ableton Live (see  [pinned comment here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfF4OX3LMqo))
    
-   [Element](https://kushview.net/element/)  (As both a plugin AND a host, Element is an excellent choice for those working in any DAW that doesn't allow for multi-input FX). Just fire up an instance of Element and load Q-Fade within that)
    

Please note that Q-Fade is in the early stages of development, there will be bugs and currently the Audiounit version isn't working.
